\subsection{Input}
This subsection comes from a different file, added to the main document with 
the input command. This is the more basic command of the two:

\begin{itemize}
	\item It inputs the contents of the file where the command is inserted (no 
	page breaks);
	\item Ideal for adding long sections of text or separate figures;
	\item Can be nested;
	\item Unlikely to have side effects;
	\item Can be used everywhere, in the document body, preamble, in 
	packages etc.
	\item Section numbering remains consistent with main document.
\end{itemize}
